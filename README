plist.js is just a simple library to read and create Property Lists from Javascript.

Eventually, it'll be able (hopefully) to handle Binary and ASCII plists, but, for now, only XML plists are supported.

For an extremely messy example, see the contents of editor/ (which, regrettably, only works in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari [ugly]; IE 10 /hopefully/ will be the first version of IE supported supported).

Enjoy!

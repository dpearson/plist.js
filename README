plist.js is just a simple library to read and create Property Lists from Javascript.

Eventually, it'll be able (hopefully) to handle Binary and ASCII plists, but, for now, only XML plists are supported.

For an extremely messy example, see the contents of editor/ (which, regrettably, only works in Firefox, Chrome, and Opera; Safari lacks full support for the HTML5 file API, which IE 10 /hopefully/ should have).

Enjoy!

## plist.js ##

plist.js is just a simple library to read and create Property Lists from Javascript.

### Supported Types ###

Eventually, it'll be able (hopefully) to handle Binary plists, but, for now, only XML and old-style ASCII plists are supported.

### Example ###

For an extremely messy example, see the contents of editor/ (which, regrettably, only works in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari [ugly]; IE 10 /hopefully/ will be the first version of IE supported supported).

Enjoy!
